    Meesha Madhavan (lit.â€‰'Mustache Madhavan') is a 2002 Indian Malayalam-language comedy-drama film directed by Lal Jose and written by Ranjan Pramod. The film stars Dileep in the title role, while Kavya Madhavan, Jagathy Sreekumar, Indrajith Sukumaran and Jyothirmayi in supporting roles. It was the highest-grossing Malayalam film of that time and ended up being an industrial hit. Meesha Madhavan raised Dileep's stardom to a whole new level and developed a cult following in Malayalam cinema.[2] It was remade in Telugu as Dongodu (2003) starring Ravi Teja and in Kannada as Hori (2010) starring Vinod Prabhakar and in Tamil as Kollaikaran starring Vidharth.[3]
